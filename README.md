# russian_consumer-price_index
The application collects data on consumer price indices for various products and services from 2010 to 2021.
To use our application, you will need Python3, SQLite installed, as well as the BeautifulSoup package. 
Unpack the python_project archive with all its contents into a separate folder. 
Run the python code raspars.py from the created folder. 
In the folder where the source file is located, two more files will appear â€“ one data.csv file, the other Prices.db. 
The last file can be opened using SQLite and see the database of consumer price indices for all products and services from 2010 to 2021.
After executing the code raspars.py run the code extract.py from the same directory. 
The folder will contain 4 pdf files with a graph of price growth for a sample of 4 products from the Prices.db database.
